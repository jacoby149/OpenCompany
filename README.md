# OpenCompany
A convection oven for aspiring code monsters 😎💯👨‍💻

**<u>PLAN</u>**

OpenCompany is a social education system around contributions to linked Github repositories. 

OpenCompany is a community of people teaching people with merit based certifications. 

It is the missing piece between Bootcamp and landing the first paid internship.

A karate dojo of code, with people of higher ranks mentoring the lower ranks.

Hit successfully merged commit count milestones in order to rise in the ranks.

When achieving milestones, you must pay to be promoted similar to karate dojo belt test fees.

The fee serves as :

- some skin in the game to keep people motivated
- a payment to appreciate their mentors/teachers worth.

A majority of certification fees [ 55% - 85% based on rank] goes back to pay the mentors/teachers. 

The rest [ 15% - 45% ] goes back to a Delaware C. Corp of choice.

Each promotion / rank increase is rewarded with : 

- Shares of Corporate Stock, configurable.
- Access to exclusive discord chat for your dojo rank.
- More opportunity for leadership in the community.
- A larger portion of mentor fees.

**HOW TO RUN**

1. get github api keys to put in the settings.py file.
2. copy the settings_example.py, and configure it to your stuff.
3. Install Docker, and run the command :

```
docker-compose up --build
```
