# OpenCompany
A convection oven for aspiring code monsters üòéüíØüë®‚Äçüíª



## What is OpenCompany?

A social education system + incentive system 

It is a community of people developing software for Company Stock. 

It is a community of mentors teaching students with merit based certifications.



## Why? 

There is a missing piece between Bootcamp and landing the first paid internship.

A karate dojo of code, with people of higher ranks mentoring the lower ranks.

Hit successfully merged commit count milestones in order to rise in the ranks.

When achieving milestones, you must pay mentors and the Open Source Company in order to be promoted, similar to karate dojo belt test fees.

On promotion, you receive stock options of said Open Source Company

[Totally Configurable !!]



## But Why????

The fee serves as :

- some skin in the game to keep people motivated
- a payment to appreciate their mentors/teachers worth.

The Stock serves as :

* An incentive, if the company blows up you own a part of it for developing code for the Open Source Company.



## A Little More Detail



**Mentor Rewards / Payment** : majority of certification fees [ 55% - 85% based on rank] goes back to pay the mentors/teachers. 

The rest [ 15% - 45% ] goes back to a Delaware C. Corp of choice.

[Totally Configurable!!!]



**Developer Rewards / Payment :** promotion / rank increase is rewarded with : 

- 100 - 1,600 Shares of Corporate Stock, [Totally Configurable!!!]
- Access to exclusive discord chat for your dojo rank.
- More opportunity for leadership in the community.
- A larger portion of mentor fees.



**Clarification** : All Developers are eligible to be mentors after ranking up once! The only criteria to mentor is that you be a rank above your mentees. On mentee promotion, the mentee is required to put in a name of ONE mentor. Mentees choose the mentors, and can string you on. It is not the other way around.
